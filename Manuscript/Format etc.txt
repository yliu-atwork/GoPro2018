Manuscripts should not typically exceed 10 pages (including figures and tables). In general, allow 900 words per page and subtract 160 words for each figure and table.

Upon its first use in the title, abstract, and text, the common name of a species should be followed by the scientific name (genus, species, and authority) in parentheses. 
For well-known species, however, scientific names may be omitted from article titles. If no common name exists in English, only the scientific name should be used.

Nucleotide sequence data can be submitted in electronic form to any of the three major collaborative databases: DDBJ, EMBL, or GenBank. 
It is only necessary to submit to one database as data are exchanged between DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank on a daily basis. 
The suggested wording for referring to accession-number information is: 
‘These sequence data have been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under accession number U12345’. Addresses are as follows:

DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ): www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp
EMBL Nucleotide Archive: ebi.ac.uk/ena
GenBank: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank
